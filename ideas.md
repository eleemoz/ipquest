## Leaving the Town
- The hero finds someone bragging about how he was the chosen hero years ago and constructed a pentagon of power way before BigCorp ever did.
- Hero decides to go on a quest to the Eastern District to show prior art.
- A troll kills the hero when they leave. Hooray!

## Patent Poison (or Curse?)
- See a book sparkling on a shelf or desk somewhere.
- Interact with book. It's a patent!
- Now you're patent poisoned. There's no cure. It shows up in your menu status.
- Status called "Willfully Infringing"?

## One Click
- Enter a shop to buy a weapon.
- Talk to the shopkeeper. Attempt to buy an item. 
- Shopkeeper puts it in your "cart" and offers the ability to check out.
- You can't just buy the item, you have to check out. Someone has a patent on instant buying.

## Patent Hoarding
- Something about local guilds stockpiling their patents as defense against other guilds?

## API Patents
- Wizard in a jail cell for casting a healing spell owned by BigCo, despite using different magic words or ingredients.

## Fellowship of the Random Integer Number Generator
- Player encounters a group of people assembled for an epic quest, LOTR style.
- They are talking about forging or searching for the legendary triangle of power that is needed for some reason or another (it should line up directly with your goal). Player is given the option to listen in or 'ignore.'

> (ELROND): We have only one choice.  The Random Integer Number Generator must be ... invalidated.
> 
> (GIMLI): 	Then what are we waiting for?
>
> (ELROND): The RING cannot be invalidated, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any procedure that we here possess. The RING was made in the fires of the Patent Office.  Only there can it be unmade.  It must be taken to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came.
> 
> (BOROMIR):  One does not simply walk into the Patent Office and file for Inter Partes Review.  Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the great eye is ever watchful.  Tis a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust.  The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.  Not with ten thousand attorneys could you do this. It is folly.

- Player is given the option to interrupt to say they are on that quest too, or to 'ignore.'

> (Player):  I'm also trying to invalidate the RING so that the world may live free of its corrupting influence.

- They say they want to help - you have their sword, their bow, and their axe. :)

> (GANDALF): 	I will help you bear this burden of proof! We shall be a Fellowship of the RING!
> 
> (ARAGORN): 	The Fellowship has my sword.
> 
> (LEGOLAS): 	And the Fellowship has my bow.
>
> (GIMLI): 	And my axe!!
> 

- Player is given the option to 'join the fellowship' or decide to go it on their own.
  * If 'join' is chosen

> (GANDALF):  Wait, aren't you going to contribute anything? ...
>
> (ARAGORN):  Well this is awkward. We kind of imagined that everyone would contribute their own inventions to the Fellowship of the RING. I'm afraid we'll just have to wish you luck and go our separate ways.

  * If 'go it alone' is chosen

> (GANDALF):  Well, see you all all the Patent Office. Good luck!

## Patented articles
- Player can enter a shop and speak with shopkeeper

> (MERCHANT): I hear you're in need of equipment! Want to see what I've got for sale?
> Yes / No

- Yes
> (MERCHANT): I'm afraid I don't have much in stock at the moment.
> Rusty Dagger / Cancel

- Try to equip the weapon via inventory
- Either when equipping or when trying to use it, receive an error message
- Fine print for weapon:

> NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED LICENSES TO ANY PATENT CLAIMS, including without limitation the patents of BigCo, ARE GRANTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ARTICLE. You may use this article only as authorized by appropriate patent licenses.

- If the player returns to the shop, new items are added. Licenses for Rusty Dagger are prohibitively expensive.

> (MERCHANT): Hey, welcome back! I got some new items in stock!
> Rusty Dagger / Fully Licensed Gilded Bow / Steel Arrows / Licenses for Rusty Dagger / Cancel

## Patented articles redux
- Shop sells a bow
> (MERCHANT): Hey, welcome back! I got some new items in stock!
> Rusty Dagger / Fully Licensed Gilded Bow / Steel Arrows / Licenses for Rusty Dagger / Cancel

- Player buys bow and is prompted to buy arrows

> (MERCHANT): Won't do you much good without something to shoot!
> Buy Steel Arrows / No

- Using bow without arrows yields an error saying you need arrows (or just can't be done)
- Using bow WITH arrows gives an error message because license for the bow doesn't cover the arrows. Even though arrows are essential for the bow to be useful.

> Congratulations on purchasing your new, fully licensed, Gilded Bow! Note: license for use of Arrows not included. You may use your Gilded Bow only as authorized by appropriate patent licenses.

- License for arrows is still prohibitively expensive....

> (MERCHANT): Hey, welcome back! I got some new items in stock!
> Rusty Dagger / Fully Licensed Gilded Bow / Steel Arrows / Licenses for Rusty Dagger / Licenses for Steel Arrows / Cancel

## Spells, Abilities, Status Effects
- Cease and Desist (lose a turn?)
- Settle (escapes combat, but causes you to drop gold)
- File a Motion (just do some damage? maybe a 'confusion' type effect)
- Enjoin (prevents you from using that ability/item for the rest of the fight)
- Serve Discovery (should always fail when the player uses it)

## Spoony Bard
- Discover an initial critical piece of the quest (e.g., crystal of transmitting)
- Find someone who fits party member stereotype (spoony bard!)
- Talk to him/her and discover he is also on the same quest, and has another quest item (e.g., crystal of receiving

> (BARD): Wow, is that a Crystal of Transmitting? How did you get one of those?
> I discovered it myself / Leave
>
> (BARD): You know, that would go perfect with my Crystal of Receiving! Mind if I take a look?
> Sure, why not! / No thanks, I'll go it alone. (Leave)
>
> (Player): Sure, why not!
> (BARD): Thanks! Took me forever to find this Crystal of Transmitting.
> What?? That's my discovery! / Well, I suppose we could work together. / (Leave)
>
> (Player): What?? That's my discovery!
> (BARD): I have no idea what you're talking about. I discovered this!
> Well, I suppose we could work together. / (Leave)
>
> (Player): Well, I suppose we could work together.
> (BARD): Team up? I have no idea what you're talking about.
> (Leave)
>
> (Player): (Leave)
> (BARD): Good luck!

- over time, random people in town can go from wishing they had transmit/receiving, to talking more and more about the Bard and "his" discovery.

> NPC 0: If only we had a way to transmit AND receive. Alas...
> NPC 1: Did you hear about the bard?!
> NPC 2: I heard the bard discovered something new!
> NPC 3: Can you believe the bard discovered a Crystal of Transmitting AND Receiving?
> NPC 4: That bard is a genius. He's done it again!
